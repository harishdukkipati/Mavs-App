##Mavs App

I built a scouting platform for the NBA Draft designed to help teams evaluate prospects more effectively. The homepage features a Big Board that ranks all draft-eligible players. Each player card displays the rankings submitted by various scouts, and the UI highlights insights at a glance — a scout's rank appears green if they’re higher on a player than the consensus, and red if they’re lower.

The Big Board also includes a search bar to quickly find specific prospects and a team filter to narrow players by school. Clicking a player card navigates to their individual profile page, which features their photo and complete combine measurements.

Below the player card, users can toggle between two key sections:

- Player Stats: View detailed game logs or switch to season averages.

- Scouting Reports: Read existing reports from scouts or submit a new one via a built-in form.

This application gives scouts and front office staff a streamlined, data-driven interface to analyze player performance, spot outlier evaluations, and document observations all in one place.
